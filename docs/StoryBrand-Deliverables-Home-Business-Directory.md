## The BrandScript

The BrandScript is the foundation of all StoryBrand messaging. Every piece of marketing content should flow from these seven elements.

### 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who they are:** Home-based business owners who have something valuable to offer but struggle to get noticed.

**What they want:** More customers, consistent leads, and a steady stream of business without expensive marketing.

**Core desire:** To be found by people who need exactly what they offer—and to build a thriving business from home.

### 2. Problem

#### External Problem (The Villain)
Home-based businesses are invisible online. They're buried under big brands with big budgets, lost in crowded marketplaces, or stuck relying on word-of-mouth that doesn't scale.

#### Internal Problem
They feel frustrated, overlooked, and unsure how to compete. Many wonder if their business will ever get the attention it deserves. There's a nagging fear that they're doing something wrong because no one seems to find them.

#### Philosophical Problem
Good, honest home-based businesses shouldn't be invisible. Hardworking entrepreneurs deserve to be discovered by people who need their services. Marketing shouldn't be a barrier to success.

### 3. Guide (Your Brand)

#### Empathy Statement
> "We know how frustrating it is to pour your heart into your business and feel like no one can find you. Building something great at home shouldn't mean staying invisible."

#### Authority Credentials
- Free directory designed specifically for home-based businesses
- Optimized for local search and customer discovery
- Trusted by [X] home-based businesses (update with real numbers)
- Built to help businesses like yours get found

### 4. The Plan

**The 3-Step Plan:**

1. **Create Your Free Listing** – Add your business name, services, and contact info in minutes.
2. **Get Found by Local Customers** – Your listing appears when people search for services like yours.
3. **Grow Your Business** – Connect with customers who are already looking for what you offer.

### 5. Call to Action

#### Direct CTA
- "List Your Business Free"
- "Get Listed Now"
- "Claim Your Free Listing"

#### Transitional CTA
- "Download: 5 Ways to Get More Customers From Home"
- "Free Guide: Stand Out in Your Local Market"
- "See How Other Home Businesses Get Found"

### 6. Success (The Stakes)

**Paint the picture of success:**
- Customers reaching out to you (instead of you chasing them)
- A growing business without expensive advertising
- Confidence that people can find you when they need you
- Financial stability and growth working from home
- Recognition as a legitimate, trustworthy local business

### 7. Failure (What's at Stake)

**What they avoid by taking action:**
- Staying invisible while competitors get all the customers
- Wasting money on marketing that doesn't work
- Giving up on a business dream because no one knows you exist
- Continued frustration and uncertainty about the future
